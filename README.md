# ClonEvol
Inferring and visualizing clonal evolution in multi-sample cancer sequencing.

- ClonEvol is accepted to <a href="https://academic.oup.com/annonc/article/doi/10.1093/annonc/mdx517/4110375/ClonEvol-clonal-ordering-and-visualization-in">Annals of Oncology</a>
- A vignette on how to perform clonal evolution analysis (primarily via using ClonEvol) is now available (<a href="https://github.com/hdng/clonevol/raw/master/vignettes/clonevol.pdf">PDF</a>).
- There has been major overhaul of code and features, including sphere of cells, annotated branch-based clonal evolution tree visualizations. Make sure you are running the latest version of ClonEvol when following the vignette.

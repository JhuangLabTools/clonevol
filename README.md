# ClonEvol
Inferring and visualizing clonal evolution in multi-sample cancer sequencing.

- ClonEvol is published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/annonc/article/doi/10.1093/annonc/mdx517/4110375/ClonEvol-clonal-ordering-and-visualization-in">Annals of Oncology</a>
- A vignette on how to perform clonal evolution analysis (primarily via using ClonEvol) is now available (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hdng/clonevol/master/vignettes/clonevol.pdf">PDF</a>).
- There has been major overhaul of code and features, including sphere of cells, annotated branch-based clonal evolution tree visualizations. Make sure you are running the latest version of ClonEvol when following the vignette.

The following figure demonstrates the reanalysis of a relapse acute myeloid leukemia case (AML1) published in Ding et al., Nature (2012). Top panel shows the original published fishplot, and the bottom panel shows the model inferred and visualized by ClonEvol.

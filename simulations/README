# truth/*: ground truth clonal mixtures with two clonal mixture scenarios: A and B
#
#   eg. AC1D1S1 --> A = clonal mixture A
#                   C1 = copy number rate 1 (1%, rate 2 = 10%, rate 3 = 25%)
#                   D1 = downsampled/small clusters (D0 = non-small clusters)
#                   S1 = parental constraints used (S0 - no parental constraint, except root)
#

# This command generate commands to simulate all ground truth mixtures in truth/
# Random seed is kept the same for all datasets using the same clonal mixture
# to make sure the same trees are generated, thus the difference is from other
# parameters such as copy number and cluster sizes
